# Capstone Project: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) vs. Traditional Clustering  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project explores **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** as an alternative to traditional clustering techniques, comparing it against **k-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN** on three benchmark datasets. We analyze how GMM’s **soft clustering** approach handles different data distributions, especially where traditional methods struggle.  

## 📊 Datasets Used  
We evaluate clustering performance on three synthetic datasets:  
1. **Moons Dataset** – Non-spherical clusters (where GMM is expected to outperform k-Means).  
2. **Blobs Dataset** – Well-separated clusters with varying densities.  
3. **Circles Dataset** – Nested circular clusters (challenging for k-Means).  

## 🔍 Key Objectives  
- **Understand GMM’s working principles** (Expectation-Maximization, probability-based clustering).  
- **Implement GMM and compare it with k-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN**.  
- **Analyze clustering performance using visualization and metrics (e.g., Silhouette Score, BIC/AIC for GMM).**

## 🖥️ How to Run the Code  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/????????.git
   cd Capstone_Project/scripts
   ```

2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```
3. Run all cells to generate clustering outputs and comparisons.
4. Visualizations will be saved in the plots/ folder.

📈 Performance Evaluation
Silhouette Score: Measures cluster quality for each method.
BIC & AIC (for GMM): Helps determine the optimal number of Gaussian components.
Clustering Plots: Visual comparison of GMM, k-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN.
